# BA-006 — Authoritative Task Graph + Ownership/Executor Separation

## Goal

Keep task truth outside device sessions so one assistant can continue work across embodiments and responsibility can be reassigned without conflating foreground UI, logical ownership and physical execution.

## Development scope

- Use shared Core/City task infrastructure as authoritative task truth.
- Represent task requester, logical owner/coordinator, watchers and current executor as distinct fields/roles.
- Represent task/version/checkpoint and references to the current execution lease/idempotency key where side effects exist.
- Support global, assistant, workspace/project and device-scoped task references without making UI session the task owner.
- Expose authoritative task continuation state to all embodiments of the same Assistant Core through projections.
- Define explicit ownership transfer using BA-004 rather than rewriting ownership on foreground switch.
- Define optimistic/versioned updates and typed conflict handling for concurrent task mutations.

## Explicitly out of scope

- storing task truth only in chat memory
- duplicating one task for each device embodiment
- silently rewriting owner/coordinator/executor during assistant switch
- assuming the device showing a task is its owner
- using last-writer-wins for conflicting destructive task updates

## Required acceptance

- Same assistant on two devices sees one authoritative task, not duplicated task copies.
- Device or foreground-session shutdown does not orphan a global task.
- Foreground switching leaves owner/coordinator/executor unchanged unless an explicit handoff/executor change is committed.
- Assistant handoff may update logical ownership/coordinator without restarting executor when policy allows.
- Executor change is explicit and cannot create two simultaneous valid executors for one exclusive side effect.
- Conflicting task updates use typed version/state checks and preserve a causal audit trail.

## Mandatory distributed-assistant architecture contract

This task MUST preserve all of the following project-wide invariants:

1. **One logical identity, many embodiments.** Multiple devices connected to the same assistant are projections of one logical assistant, not independent minds that later synchronize.
2. **One authoritative durable state, many contextual projections.** Shared/authoritative state may contain committed identity/profile references, durable assistant↔user relationship state, committed memory references, the task graph, commitments, checkpoints and the causal/event log. Live token context, scratch reasoning, temporary plan drafts, uncommitted inference and device/UI transient state remain embodiment-local unless explicitly promoted through a typed commit/update.
3. **Foreground binding is not task ownership.** Each device has at most one foreground assistant, but foreground switching does not by itself transfer, cancel, pause or recreate task ownership or background execution.
4. **Ownership is not execution.** A task may distinguish logical owner/coordinator from its current executor. Any externally visible or state-changing side effect must be guarded by authoritative task/version state plus an execution lease and an idempotency/action key.
5. **Handoff never transfers authority implicitly.** A handoff may transfer responsibility, checkpoint/evidence and references, but never permission or capability grants. The receiving assistant/device must recompute effective permission from current policy and capability.
6. **Local state is a cache, not authority.** After disconnect/restart/reconnect, an embodiment must re-fetch authoritative task/binding state and revalidate any lease before resuming a side effect.
7. **Knowledge is not disclosure authority.** Information known in one scope/audience is not automatically releasable in another. Context projection must enforce memory/audience/privacy scope before output.

These are acceptance constraints, not optional future enhancements.

## Project gate

The Pre-Assistant foundation gate is already **OPEN**. The common Butler project baseline is pinned to Utopia main:

`82ed36933fb4c5b00e44768d9e1aedec1d525d9c`

This task may be claimed now. It MUST branch from that exact baseline so BA-001..BA-009 remain independently integrable.

## Development stage

The Development Host must:
1. claim this stage in City;
2. create `assistant/BA-006-shared-task-coordination` from the pinned Butler baseline;
3. implement only this bounded scope plus the mandatory architecture contract above;
4. add positive and negative tests, including concurrency/recovery tests relevant to this task;
5. push and run relevant GitHub CI;
6. write DEVELOPMENT_REPORT.md with exact files, tests, failures/fixes, branch/head and CI;
7. mark development_complete only when green.

Do not merge to Utopia main.

## Correction stage

The Correction Host must be the other physical host and must independently inspect the pushed Development branch for relevant architecture, state-consistency, concurrency, permission/privacy, lifecycle, recovery, stale-state, duplicate-side-effect and false-success defects.

Correction is a repair task, not passive verification. Every discovered in-scope defect must be directly fixed on this same branch and covered by regression tests. Cross-subproject issues must be fixed at this task's local contract/guard and recorded for final integration rather than copying another BA implementation.

Push the corrected head, run relevant GitHub CI, write CORRECTION_REPORT.md and mark correction_complete only when green.

## Two-host gate

Final-merge eligibility requires:
- Development Host != Correction Host;
- branch history/evidence proves both Alien and Mech participated;
- development_complete = true;
- correction_complete = true.

## Global cross-programme no-idle rule

This task participates in the normative global BA/RF/GAI/EM pool defined by `mission-book/CROSS_PROGRAMME_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md`.

- Alien and Mech are both available; this task may be claimed immediately.
- Ordinary claim truth is written only to this task workbook frontmatter and reports; do not serialize claims through README/MISSION_INDEX.
- Development and Correction remain opposite-host stages on this task branch.
- If this stage is waiting on hosted CI, a long test or an external condition, keep the claim but release the physical host to claim another eligible global stage in a separate worktree.
- Missing RF/GAI/EM sibling implementations never block bounded Butler work; use stable interfaces/test doubles and record the integration seam.
- A host stops claiming only after a fresh scan of all four programmes finds no actionable owned repair, no eligible opposite-host Correction and no unclaimed Development.

## Merge lock

No worker may merge `assistant/BA-006-shared-task-coordination` to Utopia main. A project-wide merge workbook may be created only after every BA-001..BA-009 branch passes the two-stage/two-host gate.
