# REX-803 three-end completion gate — measured status (Mech, 2026-10-06T02:25Z)

The workbook's completion gate is: *"至少一组 controlled campaign 可在 Alien + Mech + Android 基础拓扑运行，并留下完整
research trace/material"*. This file records what this host **measured** on the live City, rather than what it assumed.

## What was done

The Alien + Mech + Android experiment was **registered on the live resident City** (the REX-803 head `57d1c919` is
running there), declaring exactly the identities the City reports, and then a campaign was attempted against it:

```text
EXPERIMENT   mech-alien-android-two-host-repetition     status VALIDATED     registeredAt 2026-10-06T02:25:20.802Z
TOPOLOGY     TWO_HOST_MESH   ("two physical hosts, each running a real worker, sharing one canonical City")
HOSTS        dev-031fdba6e94c4298a0956ff04a65481d   (this host's reference node, online)
             alien-reference-node                    (the Alien host's node - OFFLINE)
WORKERS      the same two
SURFACES     dev-be7832e35fc34b85966c3bb43a992e1d   (physical Android handset OPPO PERM00, controlOnline)
SOFTWARE     utopia@57d1c919ff2fc8bb64ce30bacbfc09ecb60f1fc1
REPETITIONS  3 (+1 warmup), seed policy PER_REPETITION, base seed 20261006
ATTEMPT      POST /api/v0/research/campaigns {experimentId, scenarioId: WAIT, repetitions: 3, warmup: 1}
RESULT       HTTP 409  TOPOLOGY_NOT_READY
```

The City's own refusal, verbatim:

```json
{"apiVersion":0,"schemaVersion":0,"error":"TOPOLOGY_NOT_READY","errorCode":"TOPOLOGY_NOT_READY",
 "detail":{"state":"NOT_READY","missing":["alien-reference-node"],
           "workers":["dev-031fdba6e94c4298a0956ff04a65481d"],
           "surfaces":["dev-be7832e35fc34b85966c3bb43a992e1d"],
           "identitySemantics":"CANONICAL_LIVE_REFS"}}
```

Node state at that moment (`GET /api/v0/city`):

```text
alien-reference-node                        online=FALSE   lastHeartbeatAt 2026-10-05T11:15:06.977Z
dev-031fdba6e94c4298a0956ff04a65481d         online=True    (this host)
dev-e1d87b2a0ec5457e822b91d81e40dc67         online=FALSE
```

## Conclusion

```text
GATE STATUS   PARTIAL / BLOCKED, and now blocked by exactly ONE NAMED IDENTITY rather than by an assumption.
BLOCKER       alien-reference-node is offline. It is the only declared identity the City cannot offer, and the refusal
              says so with the live worker and surface list it CAN offer.
WHAT IS DONE  Mech + Android was exercised end to end (two campaigns, see the sibling evidence files in
              utopia:evidence/raw/mission-book/REX-803/), and the three-end experiment is now REGISTERED, so the run
              is a single command once the Alien host's node is online.
WHAT IS NOT   The Alien half of the topology has never been online during this task (last heartbeat
              2026-10-05T11:15:06Z, before REX-803 development began). No three-end campaign result is claimed.
HOW TO RUN    with the Alien node online, POST /api/v0/research/campaigns
              {"experimentId":"mech-alien-android-two-host-repetition","scenarioId":"WAIT","repetitions":3,"warmup":1}
              and read the receipt at GET /api/v0/research/campaigns/<campaignId>.

## Evidence files

```text
this file                                        mission-book/reports/REX-803/THREE_END_GATE_MEASUREMENT.md
the same measurement as machine-readable JSON    local runtime artifact
                                                 D:/utopia-chat/evidence/REX-803/three-end-gate-attempt.json
                                                 (not committed to the implementation repo, because adding it would move
                                                 the reviewed head 57d1c919 and invalidate its recorded exact-head CI)
```

This measurement is **not** the gate and is not recorded as such: it is the gate's current, measured blocker.
